@jadetree/currency
==================

Javascript localized currency and money handling library for the Jadetree
budgeting software. It includes a Money class with "batteries included"
localization using Unicode CLDR data.

Using jt-currency is easy:

```javascript
import { Money, Currency, Locale } from '@jadetree/currency';

// Load l10n data from the locales sub-package
import { de_DE } from '@jadetree/currency/locales/de';
import { en_US } from '@jadetree/currency/locales/en';

/* CommonJS (Node.js) Syntax */
const { Money, Currency, Locale } = require('@jadetree/currency');
const { de_DE } = require('@jadetree/currency/locales/de');
const { en_US } = require('@jadetree/currency/locales/en');

// Create a Money Object with USD $4.00
const m = new Money('4.00', 'USD');

// Add and Subtract Amounts
const m2 = m.add(1).subtract('0.50');

// Format into a localized string
m2.format(en_US);     // '$4.50'
m2.format(de_DE);     // '4,50\u00a0$'

// Localized parsing works too, with default currency for the locale
const m3 = new Money('1 234,56', new Locale('fr_FR'));
m3.format(new Locale('en_US'));     // â‚¬1,234.56
```

For use in a browser without additional packaging (e.g. when a backend API can
determine which locale data to serve), the files in the dist directory may be
included as script tags, as in the following example which loads only the
German localization data to reduce transfer and load time.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://a-great-cdn/dist/jt-currency.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://a-great-cdn/dist/jt-l10n.de.js"></script>
```

For a working example of jt-currency in a single HTML page, open the index.html
file in the demo folder in your browser.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asymworks/jt-currency.git
cd jt-currency/demo
open index.html
```
